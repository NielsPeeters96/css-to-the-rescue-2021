# Restaurant Menu
I never worked with HTML and CSS as much as I did now. Learned alot of thing, like animations, selectors, shapes, linear gradients, keyframes, etc. It was very fun to do and I will keep practicing. At first I thought about practicing alot of new things and combining them to make a good website. During the execution it turned out that many things were mixed up. Then I put some code in comments, so that it became a bit nicer and clearer.

## Summary
### Week 1

In the first week of this course, I started without first coming up with a plan. I wanted to add many different elements, but at a certain point it became very unclear, so I also deleted some points. It was my first time programming with CSS and I found it to go quite smoothly.

### Week 2

In the second week I received feedback that I should not just add all kinds of things and make them more of a whole. In addition, I could also add various points, such as pausing animations or User feedback, such as buttons that help users operate the menu.

### Week 3

In week three I tried to add different points from the lectures to my own application, for example, think of different transform animations and scroll behavior. I haven't really been able to implement the last point, because you don't have to scroll the page. During this week I got stuck on pausing animations a lot and finally succeeded by an example of Mister Vasillis his application.

### Week 4

This was the week of the assessment and I tried to dot the I's and go through all the code. I commented out the details and summary code so that the end product was more of a whole. Unfortunately I did not pass the assessment and I received feedback that the pause animation button is not in the right place and that some other points were not user-friendly. In addition, my ReadME was not in order because I had not completed the weekly progress.

### Resit

For the resit I made my application more user-friendly by placing the button in the right place. I aligned the three bottom dishes more across the page and gave them a nice margin. In addition, I supplemented my ReadME with a weekly progression and hope to get the resit this way. I also adjusted the font and grotes and added extra animations
