I never worked with HTML and CSS as much as I did now. Learned alot of thing, like animations, selectors, shapes, linear gradients, keyframes, etc. It was very fun to do and I will keep practicing. At first I thought about practicing alot of new things and combining them to make a good website. During the execution it turned out that many things were mixed up. Then I put some code in comments, so that it became a bit nicer and clearer.
